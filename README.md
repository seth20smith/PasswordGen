Using HTML, CSS, and JS I was able to create a Password Generator site that creates a new randomized password. It prompts users to confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. A password is generated that matches the selected criteria the user chooses and displayed on the screen.
